# Important

* Retry on failed add/delete, when notification is touched, or with buttons in the Notification
* delete multiple urls
* Reload URLs, when showing the list and content is older than X. Because of caching the JSON, the content can be old, when its not refreshed using the menuentry.
* one Notification per URL which is sent, maybe automatically removed when the url was successfully sent.
* re-send list for urls, which failed to upload as a tab in the client, maybe an own "sending" tab with progressbars for urls, which are currently still waiting if sending succeeds.
* Show an error when sharing an URL before configuring the user/server settings.

# Nice to have
* Add tags after adding an URL
* Text Filter, i.e. to remove additional text like twitter puts around shared tweets.
